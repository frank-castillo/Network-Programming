For this first programming assignment, take the simple echo client server console application we developed in class and expand it to become a chat application between 2 friends. 
Here are the specs:
	1-The person who starts the server will wait for the client to connect. Then enters the chatting mode. 
	The chatting mode ends when the client sends an empty msg, meaning request to disconnect.

	2-Client app should provide ip address of the server and also the port number as command line argument. 
		THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. So do not use defaultPort, as it is currently done in the sample code attached.
	2-Chat application on both ends should grab msg from users and send it to the other side..

	3-The other side should optionally save the address and info of the friend in a list for future application when we will have multiple friends chatting together. 
		At that point you would need to know which friend is send you the msg.

Note: I have cleaned up the server and client code so it is cleaner and simpler.
